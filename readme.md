### Wirelessly controlled robot

This project is the result of an internship for an educational company. 
The robot is build with Arduino parts and controlled by Smartphone app using serial communication over Bluetooth.
There are three part :
1. **The Mechanical Design**: Contains a 3D conception of the robot is it would be produced using Plexiglas.
2. **The Arduino schematic** : COntains the electronic parts and how they are connected.
3. **The Android App and the Adruino Script** : The app would be used to control the robot, and the script should be installed in the Arduino UNO board to be be controlled by the app.

In my internship we didn't produce the Robot based on my 3D design due to the cold of cutting the parts, we only did the cut for the Robot arm, and for the chassis we used a commonly cheap one for Arduino projects
